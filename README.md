B. Transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek.
C. Traditional hard drives are slow and simple things like dust can cause a failure and solid state meant for speed, also there is no latency with solid state less can go wrong aswell
D1. if  there is not enough ram some data will stay on the slower hard drive it has to go back to the hard drive instead of striaght to the cpu
D2. 64 bit means the dimm can transfer 64 bits at a time and the older simm could only transfer 32 bits at a time
